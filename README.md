# Grouper
Generate groups with a minimum number of repeat group compositions. Grouper identifies the number of times each pair of individuals has been grouped together, and attempts to create groups with the lowest number of previously paired individuals.

Rerun until you find an acceptable group. Save to memory so future groups won't have the same makeup.

Introducing attributes...
Create attribute categories and assign attributes to individual group members. Grouper will attempt to reduce the number of times group members with matching attributes will be grouped together.

Customize attribute weight on a scale of 1-5. A higher number will make it less likely for members with matching attribute to be put in the same group. Select zero and that attribute will not affect the outcome.
